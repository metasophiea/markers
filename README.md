Modification of Daniel Sandler's Markers app for Android

The pressure sensitivity of this drawing app broke on my tablet; so I've taken it upon myself to fix the problem, tailoring the app to my device in the process.
I've also adjusted the drawing density, expanding the drawing space.

My tablet is a Samsung Tab 2 10.1 (GT-P5110) running Android 4.2.2
